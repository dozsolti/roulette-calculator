step A:
- more chips {X}
- UI fix
- number list as table {X}
- add bet into url

step B:
- easy and pretty to share the results
- easy to copy bets
- single 0 / double 00 option

step C:
- simplify bet
    - if all 3 columns have bets => reduce all bets by the min value
        - same for rows(1st,2nd,3rd), colors(red/black), parity(odd/even) or sections(1-18/19-36)
        example:
            1ST DOZEN: $3 - 2ND DOZEN: $5 - 3RD DOZEN: $4
            Total bet: $12 - Chance to win: 31.58% - Avg profit: $-0.63 - Avg win: $3.00
        will be reduced to:
            2ND DOZEN: $2 - 3RD DOZEN: $1
            Total bet: $3 - Chance to win: 31.58% - Avg profit: $-0.16 - Avg win: $3.00
